Introduction : An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.” It is commonly said to be fit on a dataset which means it is applied on the dataset.
There are many types of algorithms with many different functions and purposes. The three main ones are:
Regression: Used to make predictions where the output is a continuous value, such as logistic regression.
Classification: are those algorithms that are used to classify between the categorical values. 
Clustering: Used to group similar items or clustered data points, such as K-Means.
